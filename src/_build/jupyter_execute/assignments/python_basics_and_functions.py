# 
# ```{admonition} Learning Goals
# :class: tip
# 
# This assignment will verify that you have the following skills:
# - Create lists and dictionaries
# - Iterate through lists, tuples, and dictionaries
# - Index sequences (e.g. lists and tuples)
# - Define functions
# - Use optional keyword arguments in functions
# ```

# ## Part I: Lists and Loops
# 
# In this problem, we will explore the basic data structures and flow controls of Python by _manually creating data structures_.
# 
# 
# ```{warning}
# Pluto is [not a planet any more](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/why-is-pluto-no-longer-a-planet/).
# ```

# ### 1) Create a list with the names of every planet in the solar system (in order)

# In[ ]:





# ### 2) Have Python tell you how many planets there are by examining your list

# In[ ]:





# ### 3) Use slicing to display the first four planets (the rocky planets)

# In[ ]:





# ### 4) Iterate through your planets and print the planet name only if it has an `s` at the end

# In[ ]:





# ## Part II: Dictionaries
# 
# ### 1) Now create a dictionary that maps each planet name to its mass
# 
# You can use values from this [NASA fact sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/).
# You can use whatever units you want, but be consistent.

# In[ ]:





# ### 2) Use your dictionary to look up Earth's mass

# In[ ]:





# ### 3) Loop through the data and create a list of planets whose mast is greater than 100 x 10^24 kg 
# 
# Display your result

# In[ ]:





# ### 4) Now add pluto to your dictionary

# ## Part III: Functions
# 
# ### 1. Write a function to convert temperature from kelvin to celsius
# 
# and celsius to kelvin

# In[ ]:





# ### 2. Write a function to convert temperature to fahrenheit
# 
# Include an optional keyword argument to specify whether the input is in  celcius or kelvin.
# Call your previously defined functions if necessary.

# In[ ]:





# ### 3) Check that the outputs are sensible
# 
# by trying a few examples

# In[ ]:





# ### 4) Now write a function that converts _from_ farenheit
# 
# and uses a keyword argument to specify whether you want the output in celcius or kelvin

# In[ ]:





# ### 5) Write a function that takes two arguments (feet and inches) and returns height in meters
# 
# Verify it gives sensible answers

# In[ ]:





# ### 6. Write a function takes one argument (height in meters) and returns two arguments (feet and inches)
# 
# (Consult the [tutorial on numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers) if you are stuck on how to implement this.)

# In[ ]:





# ### 7) Verify that the "round trip" conversion from and back to meters is consistent 
# 
# Check for 3 different values of height in meters

# In[ ]:
