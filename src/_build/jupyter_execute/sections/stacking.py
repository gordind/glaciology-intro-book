# # Stacking ApRES data
# Inspired by Joel's question [here](https://github.com/autonomous-phase-sensitive-radar/theory/issues/2#issue-1182588048).
# 
# A page to describe 
# - the purpose of stacking the data you get from ApRES chirps
# - how its done
# - a demostration of how it reduces the noise floor, potentially using [Impdar](https://github.com/dlilien/ImpDAR).
