# Introduction to ice flow
One of the most remarkable facts about ice is that under certain circumstances it flows under its own weight like a fluid. This is one of the things that excites glaciologists the most about their subject. The ice we are referring to here is nt some exotic family of ice that is softer than the frozen water we experience in our every day lives. It is in many ways similiar to the ice you make in your freezer and it behaves in many of the same ways: if you dropped a chinkof it on to a hard surface it is likely to shatter, if were walking on a sheet of it and you fell over it would hurt as much as falling on concrete. And yet, when enough (essentially) ordinary water ice gather in one place it flows under the influence of gravity.

Using fifteen images from Landsat, this animation compresses 25 years of change into 1.5 seconds to reveal the complex behaviour of the surging glaciers in the Panmah region of the Karakoram mountain range in Asia. Glaciers are shown in pale blue, snow in light blue to cyan, clouds in white, water in dark blue, vegetation in green and bare terrain in pink to brown.

Ice flow is not just a curiosity. It is one of the key components of glacial systems. This because it controls how ice sheets and glaciers grow and shrink. To understand this we will first need to discuss how ice sheets gain and lose ice and how this depends on location.

# Accumulation and ablation
Glacier and ice sheets gain mass through several processes, collectively known simply as accumulation. This includes deposition, whereby water vapor condenses as ice, freezing of rain or meltwater, avalanching, and, most importantly by far, snow fall. % this happens at high elevation where is cold

% ablation % this happens at the edges of ice sheets and at lower elevations


Ice flow controls how ice gets from the areas where accumulation dominates to the areas where ablation dominates. Therefore the rate at which ice flows is a primary control on how fast ice sheets grow and shrink. A dramatic example of this is
tica.

Before we dive in to the physics of ice flow and begin to build an understanding of what controls, let's gain some intuition use ice velocity and surface elevation data from Antarctica.
