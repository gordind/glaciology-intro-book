## Introduction to ice flow
One of the most remarkable facts about ice is that under certain circumstances it flows under its own weight like a fluid. This is one of the things that excites glaciologists the most about their subject. The ice we are referring to here is not some exotic family of ice that is softer than the frozen water we experience in our every day lives. It is in many ways similiar to the ice you make in your freezer and it behaves in many of the same ways: if you threw a chunk of this ice at a hard surface it will shatter, if you were walking on this ice and you fell over it would hurt as much as falling on concrete. And yet, when enough water ice gathers in one place it flows under the influence of gravity.

Using fifteen images from Landsat, this animation compresses 25 years of change into 1.5 seconds to reveal the complex behaviour of the surging glaciers in the Panmah region of the Karakoram mountain range in Asia. Glaciers are shown in pale blue, snow in light blue to cyan, clouds in white, water in dark blue, vegetation in green and bare terrain in pink to brown.

Ice flow is not just a curiosity. It is one of the key components of glacial systems. This because it controls how ice sheets and glaciers grow and shrink. To understand this we will first need to discuss how ice sheets and glaciers gain and lose mass and how this depends on location.

```{note}
In what follows we use the terms 'glacier' and 'ice sheet' interchangably.

## Accumulation and ablation
Glacier and ice sheets gain mass through several processes, collectively known as **accumulation**. These includes deposition, where water vapor condenses as ice, freezing of rain or meltwater, avalanching, and, most importantly by far, snowfall. 

Glaciers and ice sheets lose mass through several processes, collectively known as **ablation**. These include scouring, whereby wind removes snow from the ice-sheet surface, sublimation, melting at the base of the ice, melting on the surface of the ice and calving of icebergs. 

Accumulation and ablation vary in space and time. In any particular location on a glacier's surface mass may accumulate at one time of year and ablate at another. The net accumulation (accumulation minus ablation) summed over a specific time period, is called the specific mass balance, $b_n$. This quantity has units of mass per area per time and is function of location, $b_n(x)$. Those locations where the annual specific mass balance, $b$ (accumulation minus ablation summed over a year) is positive make up the 'accumulation zone' and those locations where $b$ is negative make up the ablation zone. If you add up all the annual specific mass balance on a glacier of ice sheet (or, more precisely, integrate $b$ spatially) you get what is referred to simply as the mass balance, $M$, with units of mass per time, which applies to the whole ice mass.   

So far this discussion of accumulation, ablation and mass balance has not mentioned ice flow. One way to appreciate the role of ice flow in all this is to consider what would happen without it. If ice remained in place where it accumulated in the accumulation zone and ablated *in situ* in the ablation zone, there would be no ice left in the ablation zone and the ice would thicken indefinetly in the accumlation zone. Or course, this is not what we observe in nature. In stark contrast to this picture of indefinite thickening and thinning (in the accumulation zone and ablation zones, respectively), we see that if the spatial pattern of the specific mass balance stays constant in time, the thickness of glaciers stays constant. The reason, as we will show, is ice flow causing thinning in the accumlution zone to conteract the thickening caused by accumulation, and thieckening in the ablation zone to counteract the thinning caised by ablation. 

A second, more detailed view of how ice flow acts in concert with ablation and acculumation to control the thickness of glaciers involves consideration of where accumulation zones and ablation zone form. 
% accumulation at higher elevations and the middle of ice sheets, ablation at low elevations and at the edges-- ice flow goes from high to low elevations. 


% also calving

Ice flow controls how ice gets from the areas where accumulation zones ablation zones. Therefore the rate at which ice flows is a primary control on how fast ice sheets grow and shrink. 

Later, we will dig into the details of this mathematically to gain more insight into both ways of seeing the interacts between ablation, accumulation, and ice flow. But first let's gain some intuition into ice flow using some ice velocity and surface elevation data from Antarctica.
