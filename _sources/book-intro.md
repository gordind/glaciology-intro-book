## Running the code interactively.
A great advantage of writing this online textbook as a JupyterBook is that coding examples that accompany the text in order to aid in comprehension can be embedded in-line as code blocks within. Even better, the reader can interactively run the code, allowing you to experiment and gain intuition for the modeling or data-analysis procedure that is being described.

This can be done in three ways.

### 1. Running in a temporary environment on this page
We'll start with the most straight forward way for readers to run the code. Using a project called (Thebe)[ https://thebe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html]. On any page that includes a code block (such as this one) hover over the rocket icon in the top right of the screen and click on the **Live Code** menu item that appears. Buttons labelled **Run** and **Restart** appear in each code cell and after a short delay during which the computing resources are spun up, these buttons can be used to run each cell in turn. Note that the code can be edited, allowing you to experiment with it.

The advantage of running the code in this way is that it is right here in the same window as the rest of the text and you will be able to easily navigate between pages. The disadvantage of this option is that you have little flexibility in how you use the computing environment (e.g., you cannot open a terminal, or download or upload the results of computations). Another disadvantage is that any edits you make to the code are lost when you close the window and the computing environment closes down.  


### 2. Running the code in a temporary environment in a separate window
